      <description>Recently I went about standing up a fresh Continuous Delivery pipeline for a new project. The project is a relatively standard containerized stack with nothing exceptional to speak of, and as our exploratory work was already in AWS I decided to launch this CD in AWS CodePipeline. Furthermore, we wanted to dogfood our long-term infra management (this project is infra abstraction/automation software) and so opted not to use TerraForm or CloudFormation templates - that way we could have a fully &amp;ldquo;Clickops&amp;rsquo;d&amp;rdquo; infrastructure for our tools to reclaim and manage.</description>
