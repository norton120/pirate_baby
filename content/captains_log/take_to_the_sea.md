The fuel gauge bounces spastically between E and F like a broken metronome, and the odometer is frozen stiff. Well, each trip is about 500 miles, so two top-offs per leg should hopefully keep me from running dry. My plan is to limp this recently resurrected 1986 Mercedes Benz 300E down to the little marina in Topping, Virginia, where a sailboat is waiting for me to call her home. From this vessel I am going to live, sleep, eat, and code. I will focus on building software I care about, maybe even another company, while exploring a bit of the world. I will escape NorthEast winters and SouthWest summers, all without leaving a big ugly carbon footprint. 

There are plenty of "sell everything and live off the grid" stories out there, and I promise this isn't one of them. Not only is [living off the grid complete bullshit](/living-off-grid-is-bullshit), but I also fail to fit the mold: I am not a kid on a modern day rumspringa nor retired with a pension, and I certainly don't want to be a content creator. 

This is about concentrating my resources, focusing - on people, my well-being, and creating things that matter.  

### What do sailboats have to do with startups?
_or, how did we get here?_
Let's talk about the last 5 years.
