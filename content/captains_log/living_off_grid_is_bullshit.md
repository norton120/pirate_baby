The grid is pretty wonderful in a lot of ways. Constant connection and instant satisfaction goes far beyond the human essentials of shelter, food and safety; in this world, instant access to the wealth of human knowledge and a global marketplace of commerce are a click away. There is little argument that modern "plugged-in" living is more _convenient_ than any other period in human history. 

But there is a flip side to living on the grid: constant connection means a life that is always on, vacillating between FOMO and burnout. Instant satisfaction translates to zero-latency expectations from your customers, friends, and even your family. Is same-day delivery of shoelaces really worth 3AM emails? Is all this consumerism and excess really adding to our lives, or distracting from them? 

For those that begin to question if the juice of grid life is worth the squeeze, look no further than "off the grid" content creators. These brave souls reject the system and shed the yoke of the rat race, living an undistilled human experience. Through YouTube and TikTok they bring you how-tos, tips & tricks (along with plenty of sponsored product recommendations) so you _too_ can cut ties and finally be free. Great! Except... it's all bullshit. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnâ€™t exist, and there are few things more on-the-grid than the "off the grid lifestyle" content machine.

Let me get this elephant in the room out of the way: making videos for a living is a purely on-the-grid play. The specialization needed to support content creation requires a hugely interconnected and equally specialized society; in a tribe of 50 people, no able-bodied young person would be excused from hunting or farming because "they tell stories for a living." You need the conversion loss of our fiat economy to create disposable income, that can in turn support a specialized role that only produces intangibles (you can't eat a YouTube video). _And_ you need a population that is so overspecialized that they are willing to consume content as an escape.

Let's also remember why content creators are paid for their content - they serve as a marketing platform. Is there anything in the universe more "on the grid" than marketing? Not one Marketing Manager that dreams of living off-grid is dreaming of doing exactly the same job, just in the woods. Clawing after clicks isn't an escape from the rat race, it's just slightly different cheese.  

## The tech of "Off the grid living" 
Solar panels. Lithium-ion batteries. Water purifiers, Starlink, GPS, Gore-tex lined hiking boots, titanium carabiners - the list goes on. For creators that seem to so whole-heartedly reject modern on-grid life, most seem to be very happy reaping the benefits of 

- so much of it is just a reflection of a life phase. "well we can do this now because we don't have kids" means that "off the grid" is a thin mask on "lack of responsibilities." This is basically Animal House - celebrating the freedom of irresponsible youth, not a "lifestyle" or a path to follow. 
- so much of it is transient, a drawn-out instagram moment centered not on real choices but on box-checking. It's like people playing city for a few years before they move to Westchester, for the sole purpose of being able to say "well when I lived in Midtown."


Don't get me wrong, I really like [sailinguma.com](https://sailinguma.com). Their content is welcoming and entertaining, and it serves as an excellent icebreaker for those considering live-aboard sailing life. For Engineers it does the extra service of making you feel confident that you can solve problems on a boat just like you would anywhere else, that there's no special "Sea Engineering" that renders your current skills moot.
