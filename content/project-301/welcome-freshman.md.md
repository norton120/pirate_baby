summary: Adjusting to the boat-and-consult world

---

Deltaville Virginia is a boat town, the likes of how Melville described 19th century Nantucket in Moby Dick. It is a place where sail and sea culture permeates every aspect of life; you sleep at the Dockside Inn, eat at the Galley bar, and get coffee from the Cafe By The Bay. The ratio of rigging stores to grocery stores is at least six to one. So it's no surprise that when I started looking for my boat two months ago I found myself here. I count forty marinas in twelve square miles (and that is likely a fraction of the real number, given how poorly marked marinas tend to be). To date my boat shopping has taken me to only six of them... I am hoping six is enough.

Her name is _Grace_. She is a 1969 Ericson Mark I. Until now I have followed the golden rule of boat shopping - don't fall in love. Emotion will make you take on a project you can't afford or adopt problems you can't solve, so keep it cold, calculated, and be prepared to walk away at the first sign of trouble. I did this just fine with the '78 Sabre, when the survey turned up a decaying bulkhead. I didn't blink when my offer on the '57 Rhodes Bounty fell through, or lose sleep over the parade of Cheoy Lees and Tayanas that were under contract seemingly the moment they came on the market. But _Grace_, she is a problem; I am already dangerously smitten.

My dog Bash and I left Philly at 3AM Monday in the '86 Mercedes I bought off a friend for two thousand dollars (with fresh new-to-me used tires, thanks to the series of blowouts we had on the last trip to Deltaville two weeks before). Along the way I realized that the headlights were dimming due to a stuck antenna motor gobbling power, a problem solved by yanking a few low-priority fuses (who needs reverse lights, really?). This trip down, the trunk and back seats of the Benz were packed tight with all my personal effects - not unlike a nineteen-year-old me limping off to college in my '84 Chrysler New Yorker. Then and now, I drove with one eye on the road and one on the gauge cluster,  scanning the engine temp and oil pressure like a hawk.

The purpose of this trip was to make the final walkthrough of _Grace_ with the seller's rep, in person, before the owner would agree to sign off and schedule a sea trial. The purpose of all my belongings being wedged into the car was that I had already decided, regardless of outcome, not to leave Deltaville without her. Love makes us do foolish, sometimes wonderful things. 

Early summer is the busy season for the boating industry in Deltaville, and coordinating schedules between my surveyor, the seller, and the boatyard immediately became an issue. The potential close date moved from the following Tuesday, to Friday, and finally all the way to the following Monday. With a week to kill before we could move forward, Bash and I settled into our less-temporary-than-planned home at the Dockside Inn.

Moving aboard the boat may be a week away, but ripples of change have already begun. It started Monday when I accepted a contract, despite it paying an academic rate, because I am interested in the project. On Tuesday I sat on the front porch for an hour watching Bash run figure-eights in the grass, without a single Slack interruption. Wednesday morning I woke up, took a shower, and finished an entire espresso before opening my laptop or even looking at my phone. If you are a normal person these probably don't sound like huge accomplishments, and If you live startup life this probably sounds like pure fantasy. To me, this is progress.

One of the greatest adjustments so far has been the camaraderie - and I'm not even living on a boat yet. Everyone talks about how boat communities are warm and inviting, and that is a dramatic understatement. Deltaville is essentially one massive marina where strangers in line at the coffee shop will ask which boat is yours; the conversations are much more substantial than pleasant chit-chat - these folks are actively interested in being a positive element in your life. I have met, on average, two couples a day that have extended an open invite for drinks on their boat by the end of our first conversation. Minutes after meeting new boat people they have offered to watch Bash while I sail, give me rides to the grocery store (once I move aboard and ditch the car), go shopping with me to buy new sails, and (of course) spend as much time as is required to teach me to sail. One might argue that this is just southern hospitality (I am in Virginia, after all). But few of these people are southerners. I've mostly met people from Boston, Maine, New York - not places known for their overwhelming warmth towards strangers. 

In many ways I am reminded of the first year away at college. Without an established social circle, we have no choice but to drop our defenses and meet new people. We want friends, not acquaintances, so the conversations have substance and take risks. 

The first weekend of my freshman year I was walking into town by myself, down a shortcut trail through woods behind the campus known as "the cowpath." I ran into a group of kids going the opposite direction, and spotted several cases of Milwaukee's' Best (affectionately referred to as "The Beast") propped on shoulders. I made eye contact and asked "is that all beer?" 
"yep."
"can I come with you guys?" 
"sure. I'm Steve."

This wouldn't work in normal adult life, but it is pretty much the rhythm of all my boat community interactions.
