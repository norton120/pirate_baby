summary: Adjusting to the boat-and-consult world

Deltaville Virginia is a boat town in the way that Melville describes 19th century Nantucket, a world where sail and sea culture permeates every aspect of life. You sleep at the Dockside Inn, eat at the Galley, and get coffee from the Cafe By The Bay; for every one grocery store there are six places to buy new sails and rigging. So it is no surprise that when I started looking for my boat two months ago I ended up here. I count forty marinas within a half hour drive (and that is likely a fraction of the real number, given how poorly marked marinas tend to be), and to date my boat shopping has taken me to only six of them. I am hoping six was enough. 

Her name is Grace, and she's a 1969 Ericson Mark I. Until now I've followed the golden rule of boat shopping (as passed down to me by countless sailors): "don't fall in love." Emotion will make you take on a project you can't afford or adopt problems you can't solve, so keep it cold, calculated, and be prepared to walk away at the first sign of trouble. I did this just fine with the '78 Sabre when the survey found a decaying bulkhead. I didn't blink when my offer on the '57 Rhodes Bounty fell through, or the parade of Cheoy Lees and Tayanas that were under contract seemingly the moment they came to market. But Grace, she is a problem; I am already dangerously smitten. 

My dog Bash and I left Philly at 3AM Monday in the '86 Mercedes I bought off a friend for $2k (with fresh new-to-me used tires, thanks to the series of blowouts we had on a previous trip to Deltaville two weeks before). Along the way I realized that the headlights were dimming due to a stuck antenna motor gobbling power, a problem solved by yanking a few low-priority fuses (who needs reverse lights, really?). This trip down the trunk and back seats of the Benz were packed tight with all my personal effects - not unlike nineteen-year-old me limping off to college in my '84 Chrysler New Yorker. Then and now I drove with one eye on the road and one on the gauge cluster, scanning the engine temp and oil pressure like a hawk. The purpose of the trip was to make the final walkthrough of Grace with the seller's rep, in person, before the owner would agree to sign off and schedule a sea trial. The purpose of all my belongings in the car was because I had already decided, regardless of outcome, that I was not leaving Deltaville without her. Love makes us do foolish, sometimes wonderful things. 

Early summer is the busy season for the boating industry here, and coordinating schedules between my surveyor, the seller, and the boatyard immediately became an issue. The potential close date moved from Tuesday (the next day), to Friday, then all the way to the following Monday. And so Bash and I settled into our less-temporary-than-planned home at the Dockside Inn. 

Moving aboard the boat is still a week away, but the ripples of this shift have already begun. Sitting on the porch of my motel room Tuesday afternoon, I spent several hours planning work for a brand new contract - a contract I am very excited to be working on and that I realistically couldn't have afforded to take in the past. I had a long call with the crew of an open source project I've jumped into, a great crew of really talented and smart people. I took a nap. 

However, the great big ripple this week has been all the socialization. When I started down this road I heard from countless sources that boat people are a warm and welcoming community, but I had no idea how that would manifest in practice. So here is how that actually decodes: a stranger in line behind you at a coffee shop, or sitting on the porch swing across from your hotel room, or at the bar acr
