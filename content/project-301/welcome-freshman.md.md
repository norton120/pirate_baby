summary: Adjusting to the boat-and-consult world

---

Deltaville Virginia is a boat town in the way that Melville describes 19th century Nantucket, a world where sail and sea culture permeates every aspect of life. You sleep at the Dockside Inn, eat at the Galley bar, and get coffee from the Cafe By The Bay; for every one grocery store there are six places to buy new sails and rigging. So it is no surprise that when I started looking for my boat two months ago I ended up here. I count forty marinas within a half hour drive (and that is likely a fraction of the real number, given how poorly marked marinas tend to be); to date my boat shopping has taken me to only six of them. I am hoping six was enough. 

Her name is _Grace_. She is a 1969 Ericson Mark I. Until now I have followed the golden rule of boat shopping - don't fall in love. Emotion will make you take on a project you can't afford or adopt problems you can't solve, so keep it cold, calculated, and be prepared to walk away at the first sign of trouble. I did this just fine with the '78 Sabre, when the survey turned up a decaying bulkhead. I didn't blink when my offer on the '57 Rhodes Bounty fell through, or lose sleep over the parade of Cheoy Lees and Tayanas that were under contract seemingly the moment they came on the market. But _Grace_, she is a problem; I am already dangerously smitten. 

My dog Bash and I left Philly at 3AM Monday in the '86 Mercedes I bought off a friend for two thousand dollars (with fresh new-to-me used tires, thanks to the series of blowouts we had on the last trip to Deltaville two weeks before). Along the way I realized that the headlights were dimming due to a stuck antenna motor gobbling power, a problem solved by yanking a few low-priority fuses (who needs reverse lights, really?). This trip down, the trunk and back seats of the Benz were packed tight with all my personal effects - not unlike a nineteen-year-old me limping off to college in my '84 Chrysler New Yorker. Then and now, I drove with one eye on the road and one on the gauge cluster,  scanning the engine temp and oil pressure like a hawk. The purpose of this trip was to make the final walkthrough of _Grace_ with the seller's rep, in person, before the owner would agree to sign off and schedule a sea trial. The purpose of all my belongings being wedged into the car was that I had already decided, regardless of outcome, not to leave Deltaville without her. Love makes us do foolish, sometimes wonderful things. 

Early summer is the busy season for the boating industry in Deltaville, and coordinating schedules between my surveyor, the seller, and the boatyard immediately became an issue. The potential close date moved from the following Tuesday, to Friday, and finally all the way to the following Monday. With a week to kill before we could move forward, Bash and I settled into our less-temporary-than-planned home at the Dockside Inn. 

Moving aboard the boat may be a week away, but ripples of change have already begun to surface in my life. Sitting on the porch of my motel room Tuesday afternoon, I hammered out architectural designs for a brand new contract - a contract I am very excited to be working on, and one that I realistically could not have afforded to take in the past. Later that day I met up with the talented, smart crew of an open source project I now have time to support. Somewhere between the two, I took a nap. These are the ripples I came for.

But the great big ripple this week has definitely been the socialization. I knew that the sailing crowd is billed as a remarkably warm and welcoming community, but how that would manifest was a mystery. It is beyond polite friendliness or courtesy; there is an active effort by cruising sailors to continually expand their circle and build meaningful connections.
