_{{<param "summary">}}_

This year (2024) I am moving on to a sailboat to live aboard, full-time. I have no meaningful sailing experience to speak of. While the sailing community has already been amazing, I am ultimately setting out on my own (not counting my dog <a href="" target="_BLANK">Bash</a>). 

There are plenty of "sell all your possessions and live off the grid" stories out there, and I promise this is not one of them. Modern technology is awesome and I have no desire to abandon the good parts and live feral - which, unless you are independently wealthy or planning on becoming a YouTube star, is what off the grid __really__ means. 

To me this pivot, this _permanent redirect_ is about drastically improving my leverage on modern life. _The Pirate Baby_ isn't going anywhere - in fact, I expect to build amazing things in the coming year - things that never would have been possible back on land. 

Why write this down? If my plan works, these notes may serve as a roadmap for someone else. If not, this will likely be an entertaining debacle.
