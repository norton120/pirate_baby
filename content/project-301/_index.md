**Update**: Project 301 is no more. I am working and living (really, really living) on Grace full time (with Bash!), but I have given up trying to chronicle the experience. No matter how I tried to give the content meaning, my writing happy keeps translating into really awful stuff to read. So we will continue to cover things that make sense in the core Pirate Baby blog - including boat-specific tech content like how to packet blend to get solid internet anywhere, or raspberry pi tricks for setting up your onboard workspace etc. But no more emotional goop, it just doesn't translate.
