For most of life, the answer has always been _more_. Happiness is supposed to be right around the corner following _more_ money, a more things, more status. _More_ is not just the goal, it also the answer to make that goal a reality: work _more_ hours, drink _more_ coffee, sacrifice _more_, focus _more_, invest _more_ of yourself. 

If you've been bitten by the startup bug, _more_ becomes a way of life. Founder culture glorifies loss and hardship as the price to be paid for success. Divorce, financial ruin, ostracism, and failing physical health are all worn proudly as badges of honor, symbols of your commitment to the startup dream. Once, during a call with another founder, I apologized for my disheveled appearance explaining that I had been too busy to shower or shave for almost a week. He laughed and turned on his camera, displaying his equally unkempt look; at the end of the call we wished each other well with "I hope your beard looks like Santa Claus before you get around to dealing with it." 

At some point the startup grind became my cargo cult. I am not sure exactly when or why it happened; there was a time when I would have been happy to spend life in a garage fixing old motorcycles, or out camping the Mojave with my family, when birthdays were a bar or a backyard filled with friends, and weekends were for enjoying the people in my life. But the grind is both all-consuming and self-justifying. Somewhere along the way "I can't, I have to work" became an autonomous response, the non-work elements of my life wasting away in atrophy. 

I founded **Static** with a friend in 2021 as a SaaS data platform for hard-to-manage extract-load jobs - not sexy to normal people, but virtually pornographic to a dedicated crowd of Data and BI Engineers. We bootstrapped through 2022 and opened a $1M seed round in 2023, just in time for VC deal flow to freeze solid. The data space shifted as zero-rate wound down, and data teams began slowing down and shedding SaaS tools. We were out of runway and had lost our market; our doors closed that September. I leapt head-first into the next startup, a well-funded AI project in it's early stages; that grind lasted six months before coming undone at the seams. 

I was exhausted. Years of unchecked startup ambition had left my life an empty husk, all existence beyond the keyboard hollowed out to feed the _more_. My once-vibrant social life had been reduced to a few friends I barely ever saw. My hobbies were forgotten - my closet was filled with unused motorcycle gear, camping equipment, boxes of raspberry pis for projects I hadn't touched in years. My now-ex girlfriend had moved out in the fall. My finances were bled dry from trying to keep **Static** alive. A quick scan through my camera reel showed hundreds of pictures of Bash, my dog, sitting places - because that was the only evidence left outside of code commits that I was even alive. 

When does persistence become stupidity? _More_ hadn't worked, and it wasn't going to work. It was time to find another path. 	

## True North
- what I decided was important

## The Plan
- 2024-25 plan: rennovate, rent out the place, set up Pirate Baby, get a boat, learn to sail, head south
	
Why was I chasing startups in the first place? It was never about getting rich. Kevin Leininger, a serial startup founder and mentor, once told me "If you want to get rich, for the love of God don't found a startup. Get an MBA, work for Goldman Sachs." He is of course absolutely right - startups are a gamble, and the roulette wheel is not a viable financial strategy. For me, like most founders, it is the culture - collaborating with people that don't suck and who are as excited about the work as I am, who are positive and adventurous and willing to take risks. These are the type of people I want to surround myself with, and a startup has always been the vehicle with which to do so. 
In addition to the culture, there is the financial independence created by a successful startup exit. Financial independence, in this context, isn't "rich" - it's the ability to survive comfortably without an immediate paycheck.
