When most people think about tech startups, they imagine a privileged lot of grossly overpaid, fooall-plaing elites with a fleeting grasp of normal life. While there has been some truth to this (especially during the zero-rate madness of 2020 when junior engineers were hired for the sole purpose of keeping them from the competition), perception in this case is greatly distorted from reality. 

Modern tech startups are home to an economic phenomenon known as the HENRY, which is an acronym for “High Earner, Not Rich Yet.” HENRYs are the legacy of the original dot com startups. The formula, “get in early for equity, go hard, exit huge” made overnight millionaires out of smart people that were willing to take a risk; forgo job security and health insurance, work 100 hour weeks for a few years, and then cash in your stock as a newly minted member of the 1%. 

The startup world of today is a cargo cult version o the dot com startup. Capital arrangements and equity offerings have evolved into a convoluded shell game, where investors take home a majority stake of the upside and bear little of the risk. The modern startup pays dispropotionally large salaries for roles that have a decidedly short shelf life - average tenure for a startup tech employee is still around 18 months world-wide. This is because the startup model is still about hyper-growth and the volitility that comes with, and you too could retire at 27.
