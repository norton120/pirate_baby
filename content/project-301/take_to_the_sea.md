## A Startup Primer
Once you are bitten by the startup bug there is no longer such a thing as failure. Every setback is prelude to your eventual prosperity, color for the origin story of the unicorn you have yet to build. Founding a startup requires you to bet against overwhelming odds, and so you are forced to decide that you will succeed, ignore all indicators to the contrary, and act accordingly. 

Cognitive dissidence is essential to taking the startup risk, but it also exposes you to a dangerous sunk cost fallacy. Once you are willing to ignore the overwhelming likelyhood that you **will** fail, that modified perception cascades. It becomes increasingly easy to justify losses to your finances, your mental and physical health, your relationships, and every other aspect of your life that is not the startup dream, because according to the prevailing narrative these are the cost of success. Even if you cut your losses with a particular idea or company, you must double down on the next one, or let all the sacrifice be for nothing. 

_Static_ was my eighth startup in fourteen years, and my third attempt as a startup founder. I was forty-two when I realized we were dead in the water; we had tried unsuccessfully to raise capital for almost a year, and the sudden shift from zero-rate principals in 2023 meant that my target customers were cutting vendors, not experimenting with new ones. We were out of funds - the $50k I had sunk into the company represented the last of my savings, and that was almost gone. For 3 years I had juggled a full-time day job and _Static_, working late into the night, early in the morning, and every moment of the weekends. I was exhausted. I neglected my health. My relationship had devolved into alternating screaming matches and silent indifference. There is a comfort in familiarity, and unfortunately this was familiar territory. Almost a decade earlier, the struggle of building my first business had been a major catalyst in my failed marriage. The startup prior to _Static_, a cloud-agnostic data science platform called _Cumulo_, had taken such a toll that when it was over I isolated myself completely for months. _Static_ was out of runway, out of time, and I had nothing left to give. 

Shortly after we shuttered _Static_, a mentor and friend reached out about an exciting new AI startup he was putting together. I had lunch with my buddy Matt that week and told him I was flying to Seattle to kick off this new venture; his response was "Cool. So to be clear, you are going to be fucking dead by January."

He was right. I looked horrible, and I felt worse. My girlfriend was moving out. I was completely broke. I was in no condition to start another hundred-hour-week startup push for the next eighteen months. But this was a well funded venture, and the founders had a track record of big exits - two things _Static_ lacked. If this startup was as successful as I believed it could be, the life-changing exit would justify the years of struggle and sacrifice (and then some). Investors call this dollar cost averaging, gamblers call it being pot committed. 

Over the next four months I abandoned any pretense of a functional life. The GenAI space evolved at a blistering rate and we scrambled to evolve in step. Sleep was replaced by short bouts of unconsciousness. Food was something I clumsily re-ordered on Uber eats while a test was running and then wolfed down over a keyboard. My usually pristine condo (I am a Patrick Bateman-level neat freak) began to resemble a flat from _Trainspotting_. But we were making great progress and that was all that mattered - the path to the big payoff. 

By late march it was clear something was wrong. Startups can work or not work for many reasons, and this wasn't working. One morning in early April the team agreed to have a frank conversation with the founders; the upside of this venture was rapidly dwindling, and critical components were fraying apart. Turned out, we never got the chance; later that same day I got the call that things were going in a different direction, and the AI crew was no longer part of the equation. 

## An Honest Assessment
I was too exhausted to be anything but relieved. After years of sweating bullets under the lights of the high-stakes table, the universe had sent a pit boss to make me cash out. I slept for two days, and when I finally came to I realized my home was unrecognizable to me; dirty, disorganized, and devoid of anything life-like. The places where
