## A Startup Primer
Once you are bitten by the startup bug there is no longer such a thing as failure. Every setback is prelude to your eventual prosperity, color for the origin story of the unicorn you have yet to build. Founding a startup requires you to bet against overwhelming odds, and so you are forced to decide that you will succeed, ignore all indicators to the contrary, and act accordingly. 

Cognitive dissidence is essential to taking the startup risk, but it also exposes you to a dangerous sunk cost fallacy. Once you are willing to ignore the overwhelming likelyhood that you **will** fail, that modified perception cascades. It becomes increasingly easy to justify losses to your finances, your mental and physical health, your relationships, and every other aspect of your life that is not the startup dream, because according to the prevailing narrative these are the cost of success. Even if you cut your losses with a particular idea or company, you must double down on the next one, or let all the sacrifice be for nothing. 

_Static_ was my eighth startup in fourteen years, and my third attempt as a startup founder. I was forty-two when I realized we were dead in the water; we had tried unsuccessfully to raise capital for almost a year, and the sudden shift from zero-rate principals in 2023 meant that my target customers were cutting vendors, not experimenting with new ones. We were out of funds - the $50k I had sunk into the company represented the last of my savings, and that was almost gone. For 3 years I had juggled a full-time day job and _Static_, working late into the night, early in the morning, and every moment of the weekends. I was exhausted. I neglected my health. My relationship had devolved into alternating screaming matches and silent indifference. There is a comfort in familiarity, and unfortunately this was familiar territory. Almost a decade earlier, the struggle of building my first business had been a major catalyst in my failed marriage. The startup prior to _Static_, a cloud-agnostic data science platform called _Cumulo_, had taken such a toll that when it was over I isolated myself completely for months. _Static_ was out of runway, out of time, and I had nothing left to give. 

Shortly after we shuttered _Static_, a mentor and friend reached out about an exciting new AI startup he was putting together. I had lunch with my buddy Matt that week and told him I was flying to Seattle to kick off this new venture; his response was "Cool. So to be clear, you are going to be fucking dead by January."

He was right. I looked horrible, and I felt worse. My girlfriend was moving out. I was completely broke. I was in no condition to start another hundred-hour-week startup push for the next eighteen months. But this was a well funded venture, and the founders had a track record of big exits - two things _Static_ lacked. If this startup was as successful as I believed it could be, the life-changing exit would justify the years of struggle and sacrifice (and then some). Investors call this dollar cost averaging, gamblers call it being pot committed. 

Over the next four months I abandoned any pretense of a functional life. The GenAI space evolved at a blistering rate and we scrambled to evolve in step. Sleep was replaced by short bouts of unconsciousness. Food was something I clumsily re-ordered on Uber eats while a test was running and then wolfed down over a keyboard. My usually pristine condo (I am a Patrick Bateman-level neat freak) began to resemble a flat from _Trainspotting_. But we were making great progress and that was all that mattered - the path to the big payoff. 

By late march it was clear something was wrong. Startups can work or not work for many reasons, and this wasn't working. One morning in early April the team agreed to have a frank conversation with the founders; the upside of this venture was rapidly dwindling, and critical components were fraying apart. Turned out, we never got the chance; later that same day I got the call that things were going in a different direction, and the AI crew was no longer part of the equation. 

## An Examined Life
I was too exhausted to be anything but relieved. After years of sweating bullets under the lights of the high-stakes table, the universe had sent a pit boss to make me cash out my chips. I slept for two days, and when I finally came to I realized my home was unrecognizable to me; dirty, disorganized, and devoid of meaningful life signs. I looked at my phone and the first few "hey are you looking for your next gig?" pings had already cropped up on LinkedIn; I responded by deleting the app. I took Bash for a very long walk. I let my eyes focus on objects further away than a computer screen. And for the first time in a very long time, I thought about where I was instead of where I was headed.

I looked back at my notes over the years, and I had asked myself the same question many times: what _would_ I do with my life once I had gained financial independence? Why did I need that life-changing exit? Over more than a decade my answers were surprisingly consistent:

1. sleep enough, run and meditate every day
2. have meaningful time for family, friends, and a hobby (usually motorcycles, as I was an avid rider before my time was consumed by startup life)
3. cook most meals myself (my undergrad was in restaurants)
4. work on a software project I care about (the specific software changed over the years, but "work on X" was always on the list)
5. build a successful company where everyone could have these same things
6. live somewhere warm during the northeastern winters 

None of the lists ever included private jets or beach houses. Most items were easily attainable by the average barista, but had eluded me for over a decade. Why? 

There is term in the financial sector, HENRY, which is an acronym for "High Earner, Not Rich Yet." The HENRY lifestyle is particularly common in Software Engineering and the Startup world, where income fluctuates violently and volatility is the norm. The paychecks may be huge, but they also disappear at the drop of a hat making wealth accumulation (ie "getting rich") extremely difficult. HENRYs find themselves trapped inside a golden cage: working insane hours for that high-paying job, so they can pay down the student loans they needed to get high-paying jobs and cover their massive takeout bills (because they are working too late at that high-paying job to cook anything). Supporting a crushing mortgage for a house that a younger version of themselves thought would compensate for the life they weren't living, thanks to all those hours at the high-paying job. Making car payments that pair nicely with the crushing mortgage payments.
