Quantitative data never really tells the whole story. As a row on a spreadsheet, _Grace_ certainly isn't much to look at; built in 1969, she is a very long-in-the-tooth 55 years old. She is petite for a live-aboard, barely 35 feet long with a comparatively narrow 9'8" beam. Her amenities are stark: she has no internet, no hot water, A/C, solar, inverter, or even a 110v house battery charger. Up top she has no windlass, sheet clutches, or auto helm - all pretty standard equipment for the most basic cruiser today. Compared to dozens of other boats on the market in a similar price point, she checks very few boxes. 

Thankfully marinas are not spreadsheets and a column of data cannot articulate how the little bits of ugly can come together as a thing of beauty. Sailors say a boat "shows well," to articulate a certain visceral reaction as you approach her on the dock. _Grace_ may be downright geriatric compared to her neighboring Beneteaus and Pearsons, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that looks half as good. The lines, the finish, and the overbuilt nature of a boat her age makes her stand out _because_ of her vintage - as is often the case with well-maintained classics. Her teak accents are subtle, just the right amount of brightwork - and they glow with the love and care bestowed on them by her current owner.

Her cockpit is enormous for a 35 foot boat. At 5'9" I can easily sleep under the stars at the helm and still fit Bash below my feet. The main and jib sheets, traveler, furling line, and 4 aft winches come together to make a remarkably simple cockpit. An experienced sailor would surely prefer a more convenient (and complex) outfit, but for me simple is a pretty big deal.

Ericson designers must have been early pioneers in quantum physics, because they somehow fit a 50ft cabin inside a 35ft hull. The measuring tape claims _Grace_ has the most narrow beam of any boat I've looked at to date, but my eyes and sense of claustrofobia beg to differ. She feels positively enormous compared to the inside of the Rhodes Bounty 42. Her layout is imperfect (as they always are) but the footprint is exactly what I want; aft bulkheads outline a right-sized galley and a stray 2nd Icebox (where my programming rig will live). The salon feels a little cramped at the moment with the horseshoe settee, large table, _and_ starboard settee all wedged in. Honey-stained mahogany covers every surface, from the bulkheads to the furnishings to the planking decorating the exposed hull below. Every inch of her is simple and honest, the quintessential "good bones" searched for by every sailor with grand designs in mind.

Today was _Grace_ an my second encounter, survey day. I had the pleasure of meeting her current family - namely her owner, Earl. He  welcomed Jim (my surveyor) and I onboard, answering Jim's litany of questions as he poked and prodded the boat. Little things surfaced, as they always do: a faulty toilet valve, expired fire extinguishers, and a ground cell issue with the shore power (deadly, sure, but easily fixed with a $100 galvanic isolator). Between notes and questions, Jim stopped repeatedly to comment on what a beautiful, well maintained vessel she was. Earl always said thank you, no matter how many times he did so. 

I watched the yard haul _Grace_ out, more disturbed than a father watching a drunk relative attempt to lift his newborn with chopsticks. Her lines below the waterline were just as beautiful, that keel a sharp edged knife made for slicing ocean.

Back in the water, we cast off and headed out into the bay, Earl at the helm, Scott and Morgan (my broker) on the foredeck and Jim still checking and testing and investigating. The day was beautiful, near perfect sailing, and Earl leaned back and said "Ethan, we should swing around and grab some beers and just make this a proper sailing day instead of this survey BS." I tended to agree. 

Scott raised the main. It was beautiful. The crisp, brand-new sailcloth unfurled with a blood-red Ericson viking logo across the wind-filled white screen. With a tug on the furling line Earl rolled out the jib and we were off, quickly topping out at just under 7 knots (per Jim's gps, _Grace_ has no instruments). Earl put her on a hard tack to starboard and we all sat braced across that massive cockpit, 15 degrees of heel on the dial. 

> "Well sir, that's all the speed she's got, so I hope that's fast enough for you" 
"I've been going too fast for a very long time. She is moving along just right."

Luckily, Jim's overall assessment was "average condition" - good enough for the insurance company. I say luckily, because by the time we pulled back up to the dock, there was not a thing he could have found that would have dissuaded me from calling _Grace_ home.

She is not without her flaws; she has larger soft deck spots that will need to be addressed in the refit, a stuffing box that is weeping more than I'd like. That little deadly electrical problem.

But they are my problem, our problems now. Me and _Grace_, my boat.
