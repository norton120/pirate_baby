There is a well-warn platitude that "debt is stealing from your future self." The logic follows that instead of (or worse, in addition to) spending the resources you currently have, debt is the act of spending against resources you _will have_ down the road. Debt functions on highly optimistic principals, namely that future you will be so very well off that not only will that version of yourself have enough to cover then-current expenses, but also some of the now-current expenses present-day you is unwilling or unable to afford. 

In terms of productivity, mental capacity and energy, caffeine is debt in liquid form.    We tend to think of coffee and espresso shots as a fuel or energy source - something additive that picks us up, makes us faster/sharper/more alert. In truth caffeine is reductive, functioning not by _adding_ energy but by silencing the brain's exhaustion signals, muting the alarms that our brains and bodies need rest in a form of bodily resource debt; and that debt will need to be repaid. 
Our bodies use the compound adenosine as the biological sand in our metaphorical hourglass, collecting to receptors in the nervous system during waking hours in increasing amounts, until we sleep and the chemical clock is reset. Adenosine is how our brainthe chemical fuel gauge that lets us know when we are running on fumes. Caffeine attaches to our adenosine receptors and blocks reception, inhibiting the ability of our body to accurately gauge fatigue. This is paramount to handling an overheating engine by taping over the temperature warning light on the dashboard.
