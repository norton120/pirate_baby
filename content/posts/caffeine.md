There is a well-warn platitude that "debt is stealing from your future self." The logic follows that instead of (or worse, in addition to) spending the resources you currently have, debt is the act of spending against resources you _will have_ down the road. Debt functions on highly optimistic principals, namely that future you will be so very well off that not only will that version of yourself have enough to cover then-current expenses, but also some of the now-current expenses present-day you is unwilling or unable to afford. 

In terms of productivity, mental capacity and energy, Caffeine is debt in liquid form.
