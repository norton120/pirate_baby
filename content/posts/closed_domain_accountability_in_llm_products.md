_grounding your ML product lifecycle in commerical reality_

If you subscribe to the Gartner predictive model for AI impact and adoption (a.k.a the "AI Hype Cycle") we are still far from peak AI expectations:

Your Linkedin feed most likely tells the same story with an endless stream of incredible demos that feel like science fiction.

But  one of false claims and frustrated users, automation promises unfulfilled, nightmare customer experiences and AI-powered products gone rogue. What I hear on calls and consults is executives with waining patience. There is still an overwhelming excitement around the potential of large (and small) language model-driven applications, but the reckless abandon with which AI initiatives were undertaken in 2023 seems to be sobering up a bit. For most of us, this is a good thing. If you play investment valuation shell games for a living, then reality is probably not your friend here; but if, like most of us, you are a builder who wants to create things that solve problems and actually _work_, then this is a welcome shift in the AI tide. 

So how do we make the transition from squishy intangibles and moving delivery targets to ship _products_ and _features_ that are an unquestionable success?
