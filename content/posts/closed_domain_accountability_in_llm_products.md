Your Linkedin feed most likely tells the same story, with an endless stream of incredible d

 but a different story as well: one of false claims and frustrated users, automation promises unfulfilled, nightmare customer experiences and AI-powered products gone rogue. What I hear on calls and consults is executives with waining patience. There is still an overwhelming excitement around the potential of language-model based applications, but the reckless abandon with which AI initiatives were undertaken in 2023 seems to be sobering up a bit - and for most of us, this is a good thing. Sure, if you make a living playing investment valuation shell games then reality is rarely your friend; but if, like most of us, you want to make money by building things that solve problems, and _work_, then this is a welcome shift in the AI tide. 

So how do we make the transition from squishy intangibles and moving delivery targets to ship _products_ and _features_ that are an unquestionable success?
