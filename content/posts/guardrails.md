There was a local incident not too long ago where a person died from injuries related to unsuccessfully scaling a security fence and presumably impaling themself on a fence pike. Amid the pundit commentary demanding more security patrols (that would have found the person in time to save them?) or an end to the use of spiked fences everywhere, I made the (rather unpopular) observation that I vaguely remember a time when you could rely on a desire for self-preservation when designing security solutions, and the threat of mortal peril was an effective deterrent to undesirable behavior.
