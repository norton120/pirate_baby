We should have known by the drive home from the movie theater that we weren't going to last. My then-girlfriend sat in the passenger seat of my pickup, turning red with anger. "You can't just let it be romantic, you have to ruin everything!" The movie was "50 First Dates", classic Sandler and Barrymore romance about a woman with a brain injury that prevents her from forming new memories for more than a day. In the movie, Lucy (Barrymore) creates an external memory by keeping detailed journals each day, and then reading the days prior each morning. A clever plot device, sure - but I couldn't live with the math. If her journals took 20 minutes a day to write (that's less than most people, and most people aren't trying to compensate for a missing memory) each page would take roughly half that - so 10 minutes - to read. That means reading a week's journals would take her an hour each day. A month would take her nearly half the day (if she stopped to eat). Within  a few months, all she would do is read, and still not be able to catch up before starting again the next day. Romantic? Yes. Realistic? No. And so we argued, the logic gaining complexity in lock-step with the rising emotions in the car.
 
_"But what if she summarized every week and just read the summaries?" 
"Even a weekly summary would become unreadable in less than a year." 
"Then she summarized those? She could keep making the history smaller and smaller, that's kind of how memories work!" 
"At some point she'd loose too much detail - memory gets vague, but we can still recall super specific details when they matter."
"Well then she could go back to the daily notebooks when she needs those details!" 
"She wouldn't be able to go anywhere, she'd need a room full of notebooks to function!"_

The rest of the ride was very quiet. 

I doubt I could have imagined that 20 years later, I would find myself faced with this very problem while building an artificial intelligence agent - supplying memories to a mind that has none, in a very limited context.
