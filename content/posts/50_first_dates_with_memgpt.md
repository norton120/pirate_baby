We should have known by the drive home from the movie theater that we weren't going to last. My then-girlfriend sat in the passenger seat of my pickup, turning red with anger. "You can't just let it be romantic, you have to ruin everything!" The movie was "50 First Dates", classic Sandler and Barrymore romance about a woman with a brain injury that prevents her from forming new memories for more than a day. In the movie, Lucy (Barrymore) creates an external memory by keeping detailed journals each day, and then reading the days prior each morning. A clever plot device, sure - but I couldn't live with the math. If her journals took 20 minutes a day to write (that's less than most people, and most people aren't trying to compensate for a missing memory) each page would take roughly half that - so 10 minutes - to read. That means a week's journals would take more
