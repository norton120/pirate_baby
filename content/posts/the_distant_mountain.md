I have an admittedly low opinion of those that find “The grass is always greener on the other side.” Green-ness is easily and objectively measurable. If you are unwilling to do the homework to determine the most green location and are content to wander aimlessly across lawns while perpetually feeling slighted, it seems like that is on you.
But there is a close cousin to “the grass is always greener” that I have found to hold true in a variety of circumstances: “the far away mountain is always easier to climb.” Maybe this is an existing proverb or a variation of one, I don’t know. But the truth in the analogy is deep, miracles
