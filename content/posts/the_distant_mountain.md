I have an admittedly low opinion of those that find “The grass is always greener on the other side.” Green-ness is easily and objectively measurable. If you are unwilling to do the homework to determine the most green option and are content to wander from lawn to lawn aimlessly always feeling slighted by the condition of someone else’s lawn, I have nothing for you.
