### History
The most money I have ever made was selling motorcycles. Software Engineering is by all means a lucrative profession, and I never have been a starving artist developer who prizes a compelling mission over a compelling paycheck. But the years I sold motorcycles - between 2003 and 2008 - coincided with a wave of temporary insanity in the US real estate market. Otherwise normal people became mad with the sudden access to "wealth," in the form of massive home equity reserves they could spend as easily as cash via HELOC checkbooks. And spend they did - in my dealership, to the tune of $100,000 boats, $50,000 Harley Davidsons, and $30,000 jetskis, often two or three at a time ("get the pair or the garage will look lopsided"). This was a time when ex-convict, high-school dropout motorcycle salesman would net twice the income of the Ivy-league lawyer to whom they were selling that overpriced jetboat. As salespeople we assumed this prosperity to be an eternal constant, and we planned, spent, and generally behaved accordingly. The Saturday after Lehman Brothers toppled in the fall of 2008, I walked out to make sure the front doors of the dealership were unlocked. Twice. Every Saturday before that one, I would look out from my elevated office and see thousands of customers across the two-hundred-yard-long dealership floor. But that Saturday, the customers numbered in single digits, and the sight of listless, terrified salespeople dominated the floor. In the coming months, most of the sales force saw their incomes vanish and their savings evaporate; suddenly earning little more than minimum wage and saddled with debts acquired as six-figure earners, these were hard times. Amidst this barren economic winter, there was a sudden reprieve in the form of the Southern California gas price explosion. Economic forces combined to send the price of a gallon to just under $5 (that's over $7 a gallon today), and Angelinos again panicked - this time stampeding to our dealership to purchase 70-plus-mpg scooters and motorcycles. At one point we partnered with a local car dealer so customers could trade in their massive SUVs and lifted trucks (for a sizable loss) and pay top dollar for a Vespa clone. By all accounts the gravy days were back, and most of the salespeople resumed decadence as usual. But the seasoned ones, the wise old oaks (probably in their 30's now that I think of it) maintained caution. They used this temporary reprieve to right-size, and reposition themselves. One sold his mansion (there is no other word for that house) to an eager young co-worker for a sizable, but still tolerable, loss. Another sold off all his cars for cost, to ready buyers still viewing the world with 2006 price tags. Of course the scooter bubble quickly burst, and what was left was nearly half a decade of the worst sales and slowest rebound in the history of power sports. 

### History Repeats Itself
I feel I'll tell a very similar story of Software/Data/DevOps (et al) Engineering in the not-to-distant future. A slow-burning period of unsustainable gluttony followed immediately by a devastating correction. Then a moment of opportunity, mistaken by most to be a return of "the good times", and finally, a long plunge into sensible reality. This is a common narrative right now, and I'll only touch on the first two parts (the past decadence and the inevitable correction) enough to set the stage. What I think matters today, and the heart of this writing, is a dissection of that critical window of opportunity. 

#### It was the best of times
We all know the stories. (M/F)AANG employees outraged that their favorite cereal is no longer stocked at the closest snack station during company all-hands, and CompSci grads dumbfounded that their first job would expect a five-day work week. Then the more mundane (but no less tell-tale) evidence; recruiters hounding you day and night with six-figure job offers, lavish perks that sometimes sounded less like work and more like a cruise ship ("we have a climbing wall!"). Rock-star impunity derived from an unspoken understanding that you were "the talent," in great demand and terribly difficult to replace. And of course, a shared cognative dissidence that allowed us all not to do the ROI 
of a decade of  bourgeoisie
