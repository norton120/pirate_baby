### History
The most money I have ever made was selling motorcycles. Software Engineering is by all means a lucrative profession, and I never have been a starving artist developer who prizes a compelling mission over a compelling paycheck. But the years I sold motorcycles - between 2003 and 2008 - coincided with a wave of temporary insanity in the US real estate market. Otherwise normal people became mad with the sudden access to "wealth," in the form of massive home equity reserves they could spend as easily as cash via HELOC checkbooks. And spend they did - in my dealership, to the tune of $100,000 boats, $50,000 Harley Davidsons, and $30,000 jetskis, often two or three at a time ("get the pair or the garage will look lopsided"). This was a time when ex-convict, high-school dropout motorcycle salesman would net twice the income of the Ivy-league lawyer to whom they were selling that overpriced jetboat. As salespeople we assumed this prosperity to be an eternal constant, and we planned, spent, and generally behaved accordingly. The Saturday after Lehman Brothers toppled in the fall of 2008, I walked out to make sure the front doors of the dealership were unlocked. Twice. Every Saturday before that one, I would look out from my elevated office and see thousands of customers across the two-hundred-yard-long dealership floor. But that Saturday, the customers numbered in single digits, and the sight of listless, terrified salespeople dominated the floor. In the coming months, most of the sales force saw their incomes vanish and their savings evaporate; suddenly earning little more than minimum wage and saddled with debts acquired as six-figure earners, these were hard times. Amidst this barren economic winter, there was a sudden reprieve in the form of the Southern California gas price explosion. Economic forces combined to send the price of a gallon to just under $5 (that's over $7 a gallon today), and Angelinos again panicked - this time stampeding to our dealership to purchase 70-plus-mpg scooters and motorcycles. At one point we partnered with a local car dealer so customers could trade in their massive SUVs and lifted trucks (for a sizable loss) and pay top dollar for a Vespa clone. By all accounts the gravy days were back, and most of the salespeople resumed decadence as usual. But the seasoned ones, the wise old oaks (probably in their 30's now that I think of it) maintained caution. They used this temporary reprieve to right-size, and reposition themselves. One sold his mansion (there is no other word for that house) to an eager young co-worker for a sizable, but still tolerable, loss. Another sold off all his cars for cost, to ready buyers still viewing the world with 2006 price tags. Of course the scooter bubble quickly burst, and what was left was nearly half a decade of the worst sales and slowest rebound in the history of power sports. 

### History Repeats Itself
I feel I'll tell a very similar story of Software/Data/DevOps (et al) Engineering in the not-to-distant future. A slow-burning period of unsustainable gluttony followed immediately by a devastating correction. Then a moment of opportunity, mistaken by most to be a return of "the good times", and finally, a long plunge into sensible reality. This is a common narrative right now, and I'll only touch on the first two parts (the past decadence and the inevitable correction) enough to set the stage. What I think matters today, and the heart of this writing, is a dissection of that critical window of opportunity. 

#### It was the best of times
We all know the stories. (M/F)AANG employees outraged that their favorite cereal is no longer stocked at the closest snack station during company all-hands, and CompSci grads dumbfounded that their first job would expect a five-day work week. Then the more mundane (but no less tell-tale) evidence; recruiters hounding anyone titled "developer" day and night with six-figure job offers, lavish perks that sometimes sounded less like work and more like a cruise ship ("we have a climbing wall!"). Rock-star impunity derived from an unspoken understanding of who was "the talent," in great demand and terribly difficult to replace. And of course, a shared cognative dissidence in ignoring developer ROI (and lack there of).  To call the last decade of Software Engineers the bourgeoisie would be innacurate only in that Aristocracy was often more befitting. 

#### It was the worst of times
We know these stories too. (M/F)AANG tech layoffs in the range of 40,000 people (as of 2/24), with more likely to come. 320,000+ layed off across tech in 23/24. VC funding at the lowest point in 6 years, and 62% lower than the funding peak of 2022. Engineers that had only recently settled into cushy management jobs suddenly upended, taking consulting or contract work to fill the gap. Post after painful social media post from displaced big tech Engineers who can't seem to find that next role. And a looming fear of Artificial Intelligence that might quickly automate away once thought "sacred" and un-automatable skills.

#### The Indian summer
During these "dark times", OpenAI went from $29B to over $80B in value. 20 new AI unicorns were minted in 2023 (the slowest year for new unicorns in half a decade). Good fortune abounds for an Engineer wishing to join the AI cash grab; typically it is as easy as wrapping the OpenAI api in a few lines of javascript and running to the nearest investor with an open wallet. "Look my app summerizes {thing}!" "My app has a personality like Joe Pesci!" and the checks pile up.

But remember I called this moment a moment of opportunity. Not an opportunity for a short-lived buck, but to carve out a soft landing and safe passage into the sensible world to come. This is not an opportunity for everyone; in fact, the disadvantages that make it untennable by so many people in the Engineering field is part of what makes it an opportunity. But opportunities tend to be like that - and if this one does not favor you, then the next very well might. 
For our purposes let's focus on statistical models, language models, and machine learning implementations. If you look past the generative AI hype and ask what the larger set of AI tools offer, the answer is pretty simple - these tools give you a way to make computers do things that are really hard (or functionally impossible) to do without them. For a seasoned programmer this is not a new paradigm; every time you have adopted a new tool or learned a new language, it was because doing so expanded your plane of influence. Consider: at some early point in your career, you probably wanted to keep state between runs of your program but didn't know how. So you learned how to interact with a database.  Instantly, something that was impossible before (saving state) was now quite reasonable. It wasn't free knowledToday you might want to improve the results of 

- these founders are young, VCs love to back ambitous and inexperienced people
- these innovators are achedemics and they are applying briliant ideas with not great code
- inexperience means the wrong "shiny objects" are catching their eyes. Frameworks that should be focused on making the LLM interaction robust, polished, reliable, and with an excellent developer experience, are instead focused on adding API connections and providers - they are still excited about what "coding can do" and missing that the new tool is what needs focus 
- What we need is seasoned software patterns and abstractions applied to create durable frameworks. what the LLM and ML worlds need right now is a Rails, or a Django, not more piles of theory code
- This is an opportunity for old programmers. people that understand design principals and are not excited about connecting to APIs, that can think through the entire developer experience and the lifespan of the software they are writing. Framework builders.

#### why this is for old programmers
- remember that surge of programmers that was supposed to commoditize us? the bootcamp armies, the shores teaming with legions of compsci majors? Well, the fortune that smiled on them also smiled on us. 
- By now there would be a glut of hyper-talented, experienced, and well-disciplined Software Engineers with lower cholesterol and a higher caffeene tolerance that you, had it not been for (F/M)AANG and their ilk swooping in like the spacecraft from WAL-E to pacify and infantilize a generation of programmers. Are there remarkably bright and talented 26-year-olds from that realm that already have more knowledge and experience than I ever will? Absolutely. But there are way less of them than their should be, and we owe that good fortune to Facebook hiring excess to keep the talent away from the competition and paying them not to work. The endless parade of live-your-best-life/social-issues-over-code/complete-lack-of-delivery-expectations fostered a focus on the "developer lifestyle" and gave us armies of coders, and very few Software Engineers. What this space needs is Software Engineering. 

#### the old motorcycle salesman
- rickman and his little book of birthdays
- what that looks like for us, if we take the opportunity
