The most money I have ever made was selling motorcycles. Software Engineering is by all means a lucrative profession, and I never have been a starving artist developer who prizes a compelling mission over a compelling paycheck. But I sold motorcycles between 2003 and 2008, five short years where most of the county's real-estate-owning populous suffered from temporary insanity (and few places with the intensity of Southern California, where I was at the time). If you lived in SoCal back then, and made a sensible $90,000 home purchase in 2001, you woke one morning in 2003 to discover that home was now "worth" $900,000. And so, being the sensible individual that you were, you rushed straight to the dealership where I worked and picked up three dirtbikes, two jetskis, and maybe a Harley for good measure, all borrowed against your newfound "wealth."
