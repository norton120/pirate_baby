The most money I have ever made was selling motorcycles. Software Engineering is by all means a lucrative profession, and I never have been a starving artist developer who prizes a compelling mission over a compelling paycheck. But I sold motorcycles between 2003 and 2008, five short years where most of the county's real-estate-owning populous suffered from temporary insanity (and few places with the intensity of Southern California, where I was at the time). Hundreds of thousands of Angelinos had purchased homes at the turn of the century, and awoke one morning in 2003 to discover they were "rich with equity". A home bought for $90k and now worth nearly $1M meant instant HELOC wealth; banks issued magic checkbooks that allowed  you rushed straight to the dealership where I worked and picked up three dirtbikes, two jetskis, and maybe a Harley for good measure, all borrowed against your newfound "wealth."
