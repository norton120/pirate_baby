The most money I have ever made was selling motorcycles. Software Engineering is by all means a lucrative profession, and I never have been a starving artist developer who prizes a compelling mission over a compelling paycheck. But the years I sold motorcycles - between 2003 and 2008 - coincided with a wave of temporary insanity in the US real estate market. Otherwise normal people became mad with the sudden access to "wealth," in the form of massive home equity reserves they could spend as easily as cash via HELOC checkbooks. And spend they did - in my dealership, to the tune of $100,000 boats, $50,000 Harley Davidsons, and $30,000 jetskis, often two or three at a time ("get the pair or the garage will look l. This was a time when an ex-con, high-school dropout motorcycle salesman could easily take home twice the salary of the Ivy-league educated lawyer to whom he was selling a boat. Since this was the way it had always been during our short careers, we all assumed it would continue on like this forever.
