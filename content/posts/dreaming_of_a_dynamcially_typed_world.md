In 1967 computer scientist Melvin Conway made an observation that came to be known as _Conway's Law_.
> Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

Conway's Law is why you will often find rigid, silo'ed tables modeled into the data architecture of rigid companies with silo'ed business departments, or scrambled and obviously unplanned relationships across software entities at bootstrap startups; code reflects the human environment in which it develops.

Recently a post caught my attention, from a young developer noting the contridiction between Python type hints (and by extension _Pydantic_ as effectively strongly-typed Python) with the traditional _Pythonic_ mantra of duck typing. Sometimes it takes fresh eyes that are not aware of the historical context to call out a bad situation, and this is one of those times. Best practices are not defined in a specification, written in a vacuum by wise old neckbeards; these practices are the codified reflection of developer community behavior in the same way that _Webster's Dictionary_ reflects the evolition of English (and does not act to effect that evolution). If the best practices of Python typing are becoming increasingly contradictory, it mirrors the increasingly contridictory nature in which the software development community approaches designing Python software - and this got me thinking. 

What if Conway's Law can be extrapolated beyond the walls of the office? What if, just as the DNA of an organization determine the ultimate shape of that organization's applications, the human social architype held by humanity's software developers will decide the evolution of our programming languages? What if Python is changing in the same way that the people _writing_ Python are changing? 

Consider the appeal of dynamically typed languages and, by extension, the practice of duck typing, when Python 2.0 was released in the year 2000 <sup>1</sup>. 
Dynamic typing was seen as the language paradigm that would tear down a barrier wall
Developers were tired of rigid structure of statically typed languages that required you to declare argument and return types. For many this was seen as a barrier to entry, one more complex 


<sub>1. Python as a language has been around since the late 1980s, however Python 2+ is really where it begins to reflect what most would consider "modern Python" in a way that is applicable to the conversation</sub>
