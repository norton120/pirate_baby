If you are a higher-order carbon based life form on planet Earth, you owe much of your existence to pattern matching. If you are an antelope and you spot a stalking lion in the brush, you don't wait to determine the intentions of _this particular lion_ - pattern matching enables you to think "that looks like enough like the thing that ate my friend last week, I should run." When early homo sapiens came across a mushroom that appeared similar to one that had made them sick before, they left it alone. Across the animal kingdom this ability to apply generalizations based on summary evaluations has been a critical survival tool, and continues to do so today; we look for patterns when we decide if an email is a scam, or if it is safe to cross the street, or if a friend is trustworthy. The value in pattern matching is that we can act quickly and repeatedly by grouping similar things together and then acting on them as a whole. This is essential to functioning faster than a tree sloth in the real world.

But pattern matching can also be a source of painful, damaging flaws in our logic. The highest profile examples of this today focus on race, gender and sexuality - areas where pattern matching in the previous century continued to echo false conclusions long after the root assumptions were dispelled. Where 40 years ago a case might have been made that the overwhelming racial disparity among the incarcerated in the USA was evidence of some kind of "genetic predisposition to crime," today we generally regard the exact same data as evidence of systemic bias in our criminal and judicial systems. 
The colorblind movement in the 1980's and 90's aimed to shift away from pattern matching completely in regard to specific attributes - primarily race and gender. At the risk of distracting from my point, I will summarize my first-hand view that while this did not result in a complete and perfect transformation of society to eliminate racial assumptions or gender and sexuality biases, there was remarkable progress made in a very short time. 
What has evolved today is a return to socially-sanctioned pattern matching on these same attributes, with a focus instead on shifting which patterns we apply. Whereas th

Every year around this time, it is obligatory for most of us to slog through at least a half-dozen adaptions of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic "A Christmas Carol." Whether it is a modern-day remake with a Tiny Tim that suffers from only having an iPhone 12, a true-to-the-original live stage performance, or an exceptionally well acted Muppet movie, you can be sure each performance will deliver the same, singular lesson: All wealthy misers are doomed, lest they learn the error of their ways and embrace the Christmas spirit - most notably, the spirit of giving (and subsequently, demonstrate this newfound spirit by handing over much of their wealth to others deemed less fortunate). 

It is embarrassingly trite to take a contrarian view of nearly two-century-old lines of thought, and there is no arguing against the continued virtue in valuing kindness, compassion and generosity.
