Every year around this time, it is obligatory for most of us to slog through at least a half-dozen adaptions of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic "A Christmas Carol." Whether it is a modern-day remake with a Tiny Tim that suffers from only having an iPhone 12, a true-to-the-original live stage performance, or an exceptionally well acted Muppet movie, you can be sure each performance will deliver the same, singular lesson: All wealthy misers are doomed, lest they learn the error of their ways and embrace the Christmas spirit - most notably, the spirit of giving (and subsequently, demonstrate this newfound spirit by handing over much of their wealth to others deemed less fortunate). 

Now, it is embarrassingly trite to take a contrarian view of nearly two-century-old lines of thought, and there is no arguing against the continued value of the virtues of kindness, compassion for one's fellow man, and generosity driven home by the tale. Nevertheless, there are elements both of the story and in our collective (mostly modern) interpretation that I have been cursed to rehash compulsively at holiday parties and family gatherings, and of which I now subject you, dear reader.
