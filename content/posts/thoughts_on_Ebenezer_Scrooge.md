If you are a higher-order carbon based life form on planet Earth, you owe much of your existence to pattern matching. If you are an antelope and you spot a stalking lion in the brush, you don't wait to determine the intentions of _this particular lion_ - pattern matching enables you to think "that looks like enough like the thing that ate my friend last week, I should run." If you were a foraging homo sapien 12k years ago and came across a mushroom that appeared similar enough to one that made you violently sick in the past, this was reason enough to leave it alone. Across the animal kingdom, the ability to apply generalizations based on summary evaluations has been a critical survival tool, and continues to do so - we look for patterns when we decide if an email is a scam, or if an investment is sound, or if a friend is trustworthy. The value in pattern matching is that we can act quickly and in bulk by grouping similar things together and then acting on them as a whole. This is essential to functioning faster than a tree sloth.

Whether it is a modern-day remake with a Tiny Tim that suffers from only having an iPhone 12, a true-to-the-original live stage performance, or an exceptionally well acted Muppet movie, you can be sure each performance will deliver the same, singular lesson: All wealthy misers are doomed, lest they learn the error of their ways and embrace the Christmas spirit - most notably, the spirit of giving (and subsequently, demonstrate this newfound spirit by handing over much of their wealth to others deemed less fortunate). 

It is embarrassingly trite to take a contrarian view of nearly two-century-old lines of thought, and there is no arguing against the continued virtue in valuing kindness, compassion and generosity.
