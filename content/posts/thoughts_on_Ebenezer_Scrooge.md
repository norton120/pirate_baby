If you are a higher-order carbon based life form on planet Earth, you owe much of your existence to pattern matching. If you are an antelope and you spot a stalking lion in the brush, you don't wait to determine the intentions of _this particular lion_ - pattern matching enables you to think "that looks like enough like the thing that ate my friend last week, I should run." If you were a foraging human   Across the animal kingdom, the ability to apply generalizations based on summary evaluations is a critical survival tool 

Every year around this time, it is obligatory for most of us to slog through at least a half-dozen adaptions of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic "A Christmas Carol." Whether it is a modern-day remake with a Tiny Tim that suffers from only having an iPhone 12, a true-to-the-original live stage performance, or an exceptionally well acted Muppet movie, you can be sure each performance will deliver the same, singular lesson: All wealthy misers are doomed, lest they learn the error of their ways and embrace the Christmas spirit - most notably, the spirit of giving (and subsequently, demonstrate this newfound spirit by handing over much of their wealth to others deemed less fortunate). 

It is embarrassingly trite to take a contrarian view of nearly two-century-old lines of thought, and there is no arguing against the continued virtue in valuing kindness, compassion and generosity.
