Every year around this time, it is obligatory for most of us to consume at least a few adaptions of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic "A Christmas Carol." Whether it is a modern-day remake, a true-to-the-original live performance, or an exceptionally well acted Muppet movie, you can be sure of a singular lesson: All wealthy misers are doomed, lest they learn the error of their ways and embrace the Christmas spirit - most notably, the spirit of giving (and subsequently demonstrate their newfound spirit by handing over much of their wealth to others deemed less fortunate). 

Now, it is embarrassingly trite to take a contrarian view of nearly two-century-old lines of thought, and there is no arguing against the continued value of the virtues of kindness, compassion for one's fellow man, and generosity.
