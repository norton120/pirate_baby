# Consulting and Contract Work

There is no substitute for hard-won experience, no shortcut for seat time. If you need Engineers within a track record of success in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Engineeringd, you need _Pirate Baby_.

## What We Can Do Together

- ### :robot: AI/ML Ops:
The "AI Gold Rush" has created a _lot_ of prospectors - don't let your project be some Engineer's practice run. Real ML pipelines, effective model development and **delivering legitimate, testabler, observable AI results** come with a steep learning curvek about the ML products we have successfully shipped and the lessons we have already learned.

- ### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Analytics:
From data warehouses to data mesh, EL pipelines to DBT, _Pirate Baby_ has a concrete foundation in the traditional Data space. As AI chips away at transformation tedium and closes the Natural-Language-to-SQL gap, it has never been more important to keep one foot in the present and one in the future.

- ### :building_construction: Infrastructure:
It is bigger than just AWS/GCP/Azure now. Megaclouds are still your core services, but 2024 will see hyper-specialized cloud providers strike back. We are here to implement or augment your IAC solution, regardless of service provider.

- ### :computer: Developer Experience:
Development environments should be Software Engineering force multipliers, catered to the needs of your team. At _Pirate Baby_; we have over a decade of experience building, refining, and containerizing development processes to eliminate trie, measuably shrink cycle times, and make onboarding delays a thing of the past.erati We will fit the tools to empower your people, not the other way around.

## Commitment to the Bleeding Edge
The Gen w e or oether

e t teligee pa ereand a e osererativ space is evolving at a breakneck pace. Experts must "live at the tip of the spear" by actively contributing to ongoing Open Source Software and academic projects, or risk falling behind. At _Pirate Baby_ we are seriously committed to laying the path forward for Generative AI Software; this means devoting as much as 50% of our cycles to the OSS and academic projects that are defining the GenAI landscape.

## Maximizing ROI with Pirate Baby
Whenever working with external resources it is critical that you maximize your return. Here are some important ways you can do that.on ma in pore otcaeprcoriing i tat a are ioly ce o laing  at ora  ati  ors  deoin as us  yo he n cac o a are f the e ls. n  w rat heee worki wt etena eor tis ra t o imi our etr ere are so porta wy o adtt.
- **minimize meetings**: Invest in async communication tools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), and provide our team with need-to-know summaries instead of paying a premium for us to sit in on irrelevant calls.
- **clearly define work**: Have work well understood and well documented before assigning it to our team. A clearly stated _Definition of Done_ allows us to work efficiently and "stay in flow" to deliver you the best possible product in the shortest time.
- **articulate problems, not solutions**: We are really good at managing our time. If we understand what problems we need to help you solve, we can plan how to solve them as efficiently as possible.
