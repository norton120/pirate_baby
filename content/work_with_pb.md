# Consulting and Contract Work

Good software practices transcend languages, tools, and disciplines; but there is no substitute for hard-won experiential knowledge, no shortcut for seat time within a domain. If you need hardened Data expertise, you need _Pirate Baby_.

## What We Can Do Together

- ### :robot: AI/ML Ops:
The "AI Gold Rush" has created a _lot_ of prospectors - don't let your project be some Engineer's practice run. Real ML pipelines, effective model development and **delivering legitimate, testable, observable AI results** come with a steep learning curve; at _Pirate Baby_ we talk about the ML products we have successfully shipped and the lessons we have already learned.

- ### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Analytics:
From data warehouses to data mesh, EL pipelines to DBT, _Pirate Baby_ has a concrete foundation in the traditional Data space. As AI chips away at transformation tedium and closes the Natural-Language-to-SQL gap, it has never been more important to keep one foot in the present and one in the future.

- ### :building_construction: Infrastructure:
It is bigger than just AWS/GCP/Azure now. Megaclouds are still your core services, but 2024 will see hyper-specialized cloud providers strike back. We are here to implement or augment your IAC solution, regardless of service provider.

- ### :computer: Developer Experience:
A _Pirate Baby_ specialty. Development environments should be Software Engineering force multipliers; we have a decade of experience building, refining, and containerizing development processes to eliminate tribal knowledge, measuably shrink cycle times, and make onboarding delays a thing of the past.

## How We Work Together

An interesting and valuable observation made in [Cal Newport's Deep Work](https://calnewport.com/writing/) is that humans are biologically capable of deep analytical thinking only about 4 hours a day. That is 20 hours of "deep work" in a standard business week.

When you hire on contract, you pay a premium for those "deep work" skills. When we work on contract, those "deep work" skills are what we intend to make use of. For this reason, **we try to limit our engagements to 10-20hr/wk per Engineer**. This is actually pretty easy to support with a few key workflow adjustments.

- **minimize meetings**: Invest in async communication tools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), and provide our team with need-to-know summaries instead of paying a premium for us to sit in on irrelevant calls.
- **clearly define work**: Have work well understood and well documented before assigning it to our team. A clearly stated _Definition of Done_ allows us to work efficiently and "stay in flow" to deliver you the best possible product in the shortest time.
- **articulate problems, not solutions**: We are really good at managing our time. If we understand what problems we need to help you solve, we can plan how to solve them as efficiently as possible.
